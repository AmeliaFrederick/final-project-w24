General Requirements

- Proper folder structure and naming conventions used
- Submit proper links for project
- Be sure to reference the assignment rubric to confirm you are completing all required work to receive full marks.

- Note: There are a number of ways you can position elements but for this assignment I would like you use CSS grid and flexbox to arrange content using the layout in the design.

- Please do not use inline/inline-block/block and/or float property. We have not covered the position property but I realize some of you may be familiar with positioning absolute or relative. You cannot use that either. Must be Flexbox or CSS Grid.

How to submit

- Submit the link to your Github repository where the files can be found and the link to your Github pages once you've enabled them within your repository. Copy and paste both links into this Brightspace assignment.
